Abstract
?? is an Android application that allows users to register other users as friends using the nfc technology, which enables proximity communication between smartphones, and afterwards let's them exchange messages containing text and/or images can be exchanged through an Internet connection.
The distinctive feature of ?? is that instead of using a client-server architecture like todays well known social networks, which store all data on a server, it uses a peer-to-peer approach and only stores data on users' devices, giving them a better control over their own data.

The idea to provide a useful communication service that focus on privacy and security comes from the invasive privacy policies that such communication services nowadays have.
