Social is an Android application that allows users to register other users as friends using the nfc technology, which enables proximity communication between smartphones, and afterwards let's them exchange messages containing text and/or images can be exchanged through an Internet connection.
The distinctive feature of Social is that instead of using a client-server architecture like todays well known social networks, which store all data on a server, it uses a peer-to-peer approach and only stores data on users' devices, giving them a better control over their own data.
