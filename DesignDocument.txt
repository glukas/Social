Project Summary:

The application allows users to share thoughts and impressions. This is done in a peer-to-peer way. A server is used to relay messages. Messages by the users are encrypted and authenticated in a way that they are infeasibly hard to read by the server or any unintended recipients. The application tries to alleviate availability issues inherent in the distributed approach.

General Minimum Requirements:

Each user has a set of friends.
Users can add other users as friends if they are in phisical proximity or if they have a friend in common.
Each user has an ordered stream of posts.
Text and images are the minimally supported types of posts.
Users can view the streams of their friends.
(?!) It remains to be discussed if -and if so in which way- users can post to their friends streams.
     ->Maybe users can post to their own, but also to their friends streams
     -> ....
